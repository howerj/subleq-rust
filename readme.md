A 16-bit SUBLEQ VM written in rust, it contains a working eForth interpreter,
this comes from another project of mine available at
<https://github.com/howerj/subleq>.

If you feel like supporting the project you can buy a book from
Amazon, available [here](https://www.amazon.com/SUBLEQ-EFORTH-Forth-Metacompilation-Machine-ebook/dp/B0B5VZWXPL)
that describes how the project works and how to port a Forth to
a new platform.
